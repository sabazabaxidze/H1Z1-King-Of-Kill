## Development

The gamemode is written in a modular fashion, borrowing a lot of concepts from object-oriented programming. The "World" scripts are separated and can be completely replaced for a new map.

I encourage people to play around with this code, create a new map and put loot spawns in it or completely mod it into a new gamemode, I would love to see what creations are made! Please publish all bug fixes in order to benefit everyone.
